Currently I have a problem where if you do drag-to-restore on drag titlebar, the cursor appears near the titlebar buttons, when it should reserve cursor from appearing over the titlebar buttons when the drag-to-restore is being done for aesthetic reasons. Instead the cursor should appear in the middle, but only if the cursor is over the titlebar buttons while doing drag-to-restore.
